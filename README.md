## Description

This are programs that make work easier
They inculde: 
1.prime number- this program filters prime numbers from an array of nnumbers.We created an empty array to hold the prime numbers. I used several loops to meet the condition of finding the prime numbers. Afterwards we return the empty array containing the prime numbers.

2. swapcase - this a program that swapscase the case of letters. We first split the string into an array so us to use .map to iterate through the characters.We used the if conditions to change the cases of each character/letter.We then join the array into a string after modification.We console.log to the the results.

3.generator - this program generates numbers in between two numbers. We always put an empty array to hold the numbers.We use the math.sign function to generate the sign of the values of the numbers. we use the while loop but also one can use the for loop to meet the given condition.The generated numbers are pushed to one which is an empty array.Then we return the array containing the number.
